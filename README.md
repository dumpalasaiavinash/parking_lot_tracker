# parking_lot_tracker
This repository contains a terminal-based application to manage a two-level parking lot with 20 parking spots on each level. The application is designed to be scalable and efficient, with a focus on clean and modular code. It uses in-memory storage (RAM) instead of a database to store the parking information.
